A Javascript SDK for receiving updates from the OpenSea Stream API - pushed over websockets. We currently support the following event types on a per-collection basis:

- item listed
- item sold
- item transferred
- item metadata updates
- item cancelled
- item received offer
- item received bid

This is a best effort delivery messaging system. Messages that are not received due to connection errors will not be re-sent. Messages may be delievered out of order. This SDK is offered as a beta experience as we work with developers in the ecosystem to make this a more robust and reliable system.

# Installation

We recommend switching to Node.js version 16 to make sure common crypto dependencies work. Our minimum supported version is 16.11.0.

- Install this package with `npm install @opensea/stream-js`
- **NodeJS only:** Install the WebSocket library with `npm install ws`
- Install the required dev-dependency to use the Phoenix client for web socket connections `npm install --save-dev @types/phoenix`

# Getting Started

## Authentication

In order to make onboarding easy, we've integrated the OpenSea Stream API with our existing API key system. The API keys you have been using for the REST API should work here as well. If you don't already have one, request an API key from us [here](https://docs.opensea.io/reference/request-an-api-key).

## Create a client

### Browser

```javascript
import { OpenSeaStreamClient } from '@opensea/stream-js';

const client = new OpenSeaStreamClient({
  token: 'openseaApiKey'
});
```

### Node.JS

```javascript
import { OpenSeaStreamClient } from '@opensea/stream-js';
import { WebSocket } from 'ws';

const client = new OpenSeaStreamClient({
  token: 'openseaApiKey'
  connectOptions: {
    transport: WebSocket
  }
});
```

You can also optionally pass in:

- a `network` if you would like to access testnet networks.
  - The default value is `Network.MAINNET`, which represents the following blockchains: Ethereum, Polygon mainnet, Klaytn mainnet, and Solana mainnet
  - Can also select `Network.TESTNET`, which represents the following blockchains: Rinkeby, Polygon testnet (Mumbai), and Klaytn testnet (Baobab).
- `apiUrl` if you would like to access another OpenSea Stream API endpoint. Not needed if you provide a network or use the default values.
- an `onError` callback to handle errors. The default behavior is to `console.error` the error.
- a `logLevel` to set the log level. The default is `LogLevel.INFO`.

## Available Networks

The OpenSea Stream API is available on the following networks:

### Mainnet

`wss://stream.openseabeta.com/socket`

Mainnet supports events from the following blockchains: Ethereum, Polygon mainnet, Klaytn mainnet, and Solana mainnet.

### Testnet

`wss://testnets-stream.openseabeta.com/socket`

Testnet supports events from the following blockchains: Rinkeby, Polygon testnet (Mumbai), and Klaytn testnet (Baobab).

To create testnet instance of the client, you can create it with the following arguments:

```javascript
import { OpenSeaStreamClient, Network } from '@opensea/stream-js';

const client = new OpenSeaStreamClient({
  network: Network.TESTNET,
  token: 'openseaApiKey'
});
```

## Manually connecting to the socket (optional)

The client will automatically connect to the socket as soon as you subscribe to the first channel.
If you would like to connect to the socket manually (before that), you can do so:

```javascript
client.connect();
```

After successfully connecting to our websocket it is time to listen to specific events you're interested in!

## Streaming metadata updates

We will only send out metadata updates when we detect that the metadata provided in `tokenURI` has changed from what OpenSea has previously cached.

```javascript
client.onItemMetadataUpdated('collection-slug', (event) => {
  // handle event
});
```

## Streaming item listed events

```javascript
client.onItemListed('collection-slug', (event) => {
  // handle event
});
```

## Streaming item sold events

```javascript
client.onItemSold('collection-slug', (event) => {
  // handle event
});
```

## Streaming item transferred events

```javascript
client.onItemTransferred('collection-slug', (event) => {
  // handle event
});
```

## Streaming bids and offers

```javascript
client.onItemReceivedBid('collection-slug', (event) => {
  // handle event
});

client.onItemReceivedOffer('collection-slug', (event) => {
  // handle event
});
```

## Streaming multiple event types

```javascript
client.onEvents(
  'collection-slug',
  [EventType.ITEM_RECEIVED_OFFER, EventType.ITEM_TRANSFERRED],
  (event) => {
    // handle event
  }
);
```

## Streaming order cancellations events

```javascript
client.onItemCancelled('collection-slug', (event) => {
  // handle event
});
```

# Subscribing to events from all collections

If you'd like to listen to an event from all collections use wildcard `*` for the `collectionSlug` parameter.

# Types

Types are included to make working with our event payload objects easier.

# Disconnecting

## From a specific stream

All subscription methods return a callback function that will unsubscribe from a stream when invoked.

```javascript
const unsubscribe = client.onItemMetadataUpdated('collection-slug', noop);

unsubscribe();
```

## From the socket

```javascript
client.disconnect();
```
